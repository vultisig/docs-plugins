# Integration Overview

This section covers how to integrate Vultisig plugins with various systems and services. Proper integration ensures that your plugins work seamlessly within your infrastructure and with external services.

## Integration Types

Vultisig plugins can be integrated with:

1. **Blockchain networks** - Connect to Ethereum and other compatible chains
2. **Wallet systems** - Integrate with wallet management systems
3. **External APIs** - Connect to price oracles, data providers, and other services
4. **Monitoring systems** - Send metrics and alerts to monitoring platforms
5. **Web applications** - Integrate plugin functionality into web UIs

## Integration Considerations

When integrating Vultisig plugins, consider the following aspects:

### Configuration Management

Plugins require proper configuration to connect to external systems:

- **Environment-specific settings** - Different settings for development, staging, and production
- **Sensitive credential management** - Secure handling of API keys and credentials

### Network Security

* Use HTTPS/TLS for all connections
* Rotate API keys and credentials regularly
* Limit access to specific IP addresses when possible
* Use request signing when available

### Resilience and Error Handling

* Implement circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures
* Use exponential backoff for transient errors
* Provide alternative paths when primary services fail
* Set up alerts for integration failures
